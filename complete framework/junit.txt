we need to add two dependencies like junit vs cucumber junit

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

junit and testng are similar but few configuration required

in junit instead of extend abstracttestngrunner we need to use @runerwith(cucumber.class)

note that testrunner should be named and ended like test eg:- testrunnertest


parallal run:-
testng parent class have scenario method it will run as parallel check in code

in order to run the parallel in junit
need to add plugin code
on that we have threadcount we can set as /d or unlimited threads

maven supports parrell execution for junit so we need to add the pomxml code 


----------------------------
diff between testng vs junit parallel runner
testng will run scenario as parallel 
junit will run only feature in parall

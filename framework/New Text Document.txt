-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we need to add two dependecies->cucumber testng and cucumber java and i need to plugin the ide for cucumber

in order to write scenario we need to create as .feature extension

and we need to give feature name and scenario name with whether scenario outline and scenarios

pls give whether its tag or name eg Background


------------------------------------

we need to create a step definition file which we need to map to those steps

if it is scenario outline multiple values will come  we need to mention in regex

i want to login <name> and passowrd

in step definition
i want to login (.+) and (.+) 
we need to mention ^i want to login (.+) and (.+)$

and we need to write the code as easy customer view

and in jherkin ->step definition we can use when or and both will works
--------------------------------

what cucumber can support what it cant

running it wont 

why we need to use the avbstracttestng

default cucmber supports junit inorder to support testng e need to extend AbstractTestng class

we need to give some chromeoptions

@CucumberOptions(features = "C:\\Users\\krishna\\Framework\\Ecommerce\\src\\test\\java\\Cucumber", tags = "@error", glue = "Ecommerce.StepDefinitions" ,monochrome = true,plugin = "html:\\target\\cucmber.html")

features=we need to mention the feauters path
glue is the step definition we need to mention the package of path
monochrome we need to set it as true if its is false it wiill run as encrypted mode
plugin we need to mention two paramters para1:para 2   para one is what type eg html : para 2 is path where it will generation

we can metion tag above scenario like @cc in feature


tags={"@cccc"} ->new version= tags="@cc" in  run file on options
